/**
 * This interface defines convenience methods for binding threads to a user session.
 * When you want to run code in a separate thread, you typically loose the
 * thread's user session. An implementation of this interface wraps
 * Runnable and Callable objects and inject the user session before
 * executing the actual code.
 * 
 * You can either use the bind methods to wrap your Runnable/Callable and
 * run it yourself or you can use the convenience methods to run the Runnable/Callable
 * immediately.
