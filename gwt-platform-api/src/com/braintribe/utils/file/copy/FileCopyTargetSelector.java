 * Second level of a three-step "wizard" to enter your parameters for copying a file or a folder. The individual steps
 * are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link FileCopyingImpl#FileCopyingImpl(File)} source file selection - to pick a source file or directory, i.e.
 * what is being copied</li>
 * <li>{@link FileCopyTargetSelector} - to pick a target file or directory, i.e. the new file folder that will have the
 * same content as the source. Alternatively, when picking {@link FileCopyTargetSelector#toDir(File)} a target will be
 * created as a child of that file and it will have the same name as the source.</li>
 * <li>{@link FileCopying } - to pick any additional parameters for copying as well as providing a method to
 * {@link FileCopying#please do the actual copying}.</li>
 * </ol>
