 * This is a ID generator for long values. The aim of this class is to provide a long number that is almost unique (or,
 * unique enough). It cannot be guaranteed that the numbers returned by this class are unique over multiple JVMs, but it
 * tries... The Ids generated are comprised of two separate numbers: the current timestamp (see
 * {@link java.lang.System#currentTimeMillis()}) and a sequence number that is atomically incremented with each newly
 * generated Id.
