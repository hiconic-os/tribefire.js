 * Signals that the test requires (running) tribefire services accessible through default URLs. Currently these are
 * <code>http://localhost:8080/tribefire-services</code> and <code>https://localhost:8443/tribefire-services</code>.

 * @deprecated This category was defined before the introduction of Platform Assets. Now one can use Platform Assets to
 *             create an integration test setup, which includes all the components (e.g. tribefire Services, tribefire
 *             Modeler, some cartridge ...) and also configuration (e.g. users, permissions, deployables) and test data,
 *             which the tests requires. URLs may depend on where the test is run, but these can easily be provided by
 *             the CI (e.g. via system properties). Therefore this category is no longer needed.
