/**
 * Entry point for all custom assertions as well as {@link org.assertj.core.api.Assertions standard AssertJ assertions}.
 * Just add a static import ...
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code class=
 * 'java'>import static com.braintribe.testing.junit.assertions.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;</code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * ... and then in your test methods write assertions starting with <code>assertThat</code>:
 *
 * <pre>
 * assertThat("").isEmpty();</code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In some special cases with generics the Java compiler may require a cast to be able to infer the type, although the
 * type may be obvious. For example, if a method returns <code>T extends Exception</code> and the result of this method
 * is passed to <code>assertThat</code>, the compiler needs a cast, because T could also implement an interface (e.g.
 * {@link CharSequence}. AssertJ therefore splits into {@link AssertionsForClassTypes} and
 * {@link AssertionsForInterfaceTypes}. By statically importing <code>assertThat</code> from those classes (instead of a
 * single static import from this class), casts are no longer required. However, this doesn't work with the Oracle Java
 * compiler (version 1.8.0_112). It also doesn't seem to be best solution. Casting when required seems to be reasonable.
 * Therefore this class serves as a single entry point for interface and class based assertions.
